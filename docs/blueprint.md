## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey intelligence, innovation, and forward-thinking. This choice evokes the AI focus of the application. 
- Background color: Very light lavender (#E6E6FA), derived from the indigo but highly desaturated to create a calm and professional feel. This works as a neutral backdrop, letting the primary color pop.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF), a brighter hue analogous to indigo. The vivid saturation and brighter color will make interactive elements noticeable against the background.
- Body: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, offers a modern, objective, and neutral look suitable for extensive reading. Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' will contrast with the body text, offering a techy and scientific feel.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons in the electric purple accent color to represent key features and benefits.
- Implement a clean, modern layout with ample whitespace and clear visual hierarchy to improve readability and user experience.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations and transitions to provide visual feedback and enhance the overall user experience without being distracting.
